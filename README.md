# Anon-Chat-Server

Easy to understand background api for an anonym chat. It can also be used for ingame chat. <br> 
 I created comments, just read them (: <br> 
You can find example clients [here](https://github.com/Braslerl/Anon-Chat-Clients). <br> 
Feel free to create you own client and share it. <br> 

# Clients ideas
